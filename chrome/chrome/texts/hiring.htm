    <h1>CryptUp is Hiring</h1>

    <br/>
    <p>I'm looking for a mobile developer. If you care about privacy as much as me, I bet it will be quite satisfying to work on something that is making privacy a lot easier for a lot of people.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><b>Location:</b> Doesn't matter</p>
    <p><b>Platforms:</b> Looking for both Android and iOS. I can work with one person who does both, or with two people who are experts in one platform each.</p>
    <p><b>Expectation:</b> I like to work with entrepreneurial people and I'm quite flexible. Want to have projects on the side? That's fine as long as important work gets done. Looking for a mid-term opportunity to learn and have fun before you start your own company? Or looking for a long term stable project to work on? I'm perfectly fine with any of these options.</p>
    <p><b>Visa:</b> Talented international folks who aspire to move to United States will have my support to sponsor their visa. You are also free to work remotely from your home country - up to you.</p>
    <p><b>When:</b> I hope to find someone by the end of April.</p>
    <p><b>Skills:</b> Other then being a rock-star either Android or iOS programmer (or both), I will need you to be able and willing to work with a fair amount of JavaScript.</p>
    <p><b>Language:</b> You have to be fluent in written English. At least intermediate in spoken English.</p>
    <p><b>How:</b> Send me a link to your github account if you published any of your code. Send me links to apps you worked on and tell me specifically what have you done on these apps. Tell me which parts of these apps were not your responsibility. I will try them all. If you have not published your code on GitHub, send me snippets of the code as well. My email is tom@cryptup.org</p>
