/**
 * This test uses JavaScript instead of TypeScript to avoid dealing with types in this cross-environment setup.
 * (tests are injected from NodeJS through puppeteer into a browser environment)
 * While this makes them less convenient to write, the result is more flexible.
 * 
 * Import your lib to `ci_unit_test.ts` to resolve `ReferenceError: SomeClass is not defined`
 * 
 * Each test must return "pass" to pass. To reject, throw an exception.
 * 
 * Each test must start with: BROWSER_UNIT_TEST_NAME(`some test name`);
 * 
 * This is not really a JavaScript file. It's a text file that gets parsed, split into chunks, and
 *    parts of it executed as javascript. The structure is very rigid. The only flexible place is inside
 *    the async functions. For the rest, do not change the structure or our parser will get confused.
 *    Do not put any code whatsoever outside of the async functions.
